          "The W16 Mistral stands as the latest addition to Bugatti’s lineage of iconic roadsters that have left an indelible mark throughout history. Joining the prestigious Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este this year was a rare Type 57S Roadster coachbuilt by Corsica, competing in the “Grande Vitesse: Pre-War Weekend Racers” category. Produced between 1936 and 1938, Bugatti crafted a total of 40 Type 57S roadsters—a remarkable feat during a period dominated by limited production. Introduced by Jean Bugatti at the Paris Auto Salon in 1935, the Type 57S represented his masterstroke. The vehicle showcased at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, originally owned by the famed British racing driver Nicky Embiricos and now under the stewardship of its third owner, boasts many of its original components. As a true gem of Bugatti’s legacy, the Type 57S encapsulates the very principles that lie at the heart of the W16 Mistral: freedom, elegance, and performance.",
